# OpenMW Color Shader
A simple color shader for OpenMW that modifies the precision of the game's color output.

# Installation
1. Download the file via the green "Code" button above as a zip file, then extract it to your shaders folder in your Morrowind data directory. The path should look like this:
Morrowind/Data Files/shaders/cellshading.omwfx
2. Launch OpenMW and press F2 while in-game to open the shader menu. From here, move the shader to the right-side column to enable it.
3. Within the shader menu, modify to color precision variable as desired.
